no bullshit osc <-> midi bridging

this is pretty heavily purpose-built for my exact show control stack (Ableton/Ableset master set, Quad Cortex for guitar, Reaper for synths), but i'm sure someone out there can find a use for it, or fork it for their own needs.

(also i'm not a rust dev by any means so go easy on me)
